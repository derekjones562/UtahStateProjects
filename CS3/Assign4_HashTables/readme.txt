- the knowlege of subject and verbs. the computer randomly chooses a word that comes
after it. sometimes it gets it correct and sometimes it doesnt. it is
oblivious when it comes to subject and verbs. this could be said about grammer
as well. the computer would generate more sensible information if 1. it started
a sentance with a subject or noun. a simple identifier would do the trick.
2. cannot have two nouns in a row. a pattern of noun verb noun verb while allowing
for pronouns and adjectives would work. 3. dont repeat a work that came directly 
before the current word being looked at. you could do what we did by storing a list
of words that come before and make sure that you dont add that word to words that come
after.


-a reason why some are more coherent is the original author. The way they build their
sentances and the tone and style they want portayed will change what words follow each 
other. this allows for varrying degrees of coherentness. the probability portion also
plays a role. the more the author repeats certain phrases, the more likely that phrase
will come up in the generated poem. otherwise it will come up with a more random and less 
coherent poem.
